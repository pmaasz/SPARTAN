 * Class ResponseRedirect
 *
 * The ResponseRedirect does the same as the Response object. The difference is the location the user is directed to.
 * Instead of loading the same page again we can redirect to a new page. Example would be the saving of a form and
 * redirecting to the page where the saved data is shown.
